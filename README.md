# gameOfLifeJava

After the course at </salt> I was in the process with a company that sought after a Senior Developer in Java for it's team and after initial meetings I received a code test in Java that was to create Conways Game of Life.

I received help setting up the project with Maven and coded in IntelliJ and received minor help with the visual graphics in Java but I built the complete logic by myself in two days without knowing the language. I have as you can see some previous experience of Java from High School but that was over 9 years ago and the vast majority of the syntax had been long forgotten. I am really proud over the result I managed to put together in just two days of learning a new language and coding Conway's Game of Life.
